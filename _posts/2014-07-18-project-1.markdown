description1: This is what happens when a couple of engineers are stuck at home for a while. Back when the stay at home order was in place here in Seattle, my wife Megan and I started a project on our living room floor to keep ourselves sane. Five months and countless mistakes later, we are very proud to have finished our homemade laser cutter. It lives in our garage now because as you can see, it’s a monster. We constructed it out of 80/20 to keep it modular. It’s sporting an 80W CO2 laser with a series of three mirrors on a gantry system to direct the beam.
