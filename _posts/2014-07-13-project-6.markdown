description1:  In high school, one of my passions was building longboards. I started by laminating plies of maple together in a contoured press to achieve concavity in the profile and increase the strength of the boards. I experimented with this a lot and made upwards of 15 of these, selling and gifting them to friends as I went. I also experimented with other methods like reinforced hardwoods cut out and engraved with a CNC router. I even constructed a couple with a foam core sandwiched between carbon fiber layups.
